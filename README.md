# Welcome to MultiDasher

## What is MultiDasher

[MultiDasher](http://www.multidasher.org/) is an open source admin dashboard for [MultiChain](http://www.multichain.com/) blockchains, based on [Drupal 8](http://www.drupal.org/). Drupal and the Adminimal theme provide a GUI for managing and interacting with permissioned MultiChain blockchains, and the content management capabilities of Drupal allow human-readible names to be associated with blockchain addresses, and for other extensions to the system.

MultiDasher is developed, tested and designed to be run on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Getting Started

3. Do some Drupal stuff

4. Go to `http://localhost:80` and you'll be asked to create an administrator account.
